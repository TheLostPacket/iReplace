# iReplace
iReplace is an open-source project that reimagines the iPod experience with a fully replaceable, modern design. It allows damaged iPods to be repaired or recreated using entirely new, readily available components, avoiding the scarcity and high cost of vintage parts while preserving the functionality and feel of the original device.
